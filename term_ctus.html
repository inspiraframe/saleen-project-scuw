								We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. That Privacy Policy lets you know how and for what purposes we are collecting, processing and using your Personal Information (as defined herein). We pledge that we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information will only be used in ways that are in compliance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

								This Privacy Policy is in effect for any web pages, mobile applications, third party social media sites, e-mail lists, non user-specific information and personal information collected and/or owned by Saleen Automotive, Inc (“Saleen”, “our” or “we”), including but not limited to the Saleen website(s), no matter the method of collection (e.g., mail, facsimile, sign-up/sign-in page, survey), including collection through this website and any online features, services and/or programs offered by Saleen (collectively, the “Website”).<br><br>

								Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Privacy Policy is not applicable to any other web pages, mobile applications, social media sites, e-mail lists, generic information and Personal Information collected and/or owned by any entity other than Saleen, including, but not limited to, any automobile dealership or service center. Users of the foregoing resources should refer to the Privacy Policy in effect for the applicable owner.<br><br>

								Your use of the Website is also governed by our Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

								This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by Saleen through a means other than the Web Site. If the same information is collected through the Web Site and through a means other than the Web Site, the terms of this Privacy Policy shall apply.<br><br>







								<br>
								Your California Privacy Rights<br><br>

								Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in connection with obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2015 will receive information regarding 2014 sharing activities).<br><br>

								To obtain this information on behalf of Saleen, please send an email message to privacy@saleen.com
								 with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address in response.<br><br>

								Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.<br><br>

								Additionally, because we may collect your Personal Information from time to time, California’s Online Privacy Protection Act requires us to disclose how we respond to “do not track” requests and other similar mechanisms. Currently, our policy is that we do not recognize “do not track” requests from Internet browsers and similar devices.<br><br>






								<br>
								How Information Is Collected<br><br>

								The types of Personal Information we collect may include, among other things (collectively, “Personal Information”): (1) contact information (e.g., name, address, home and mobile telephone numbers, email address); (2) biographical information such as household data, preferences, and demographic information (e.g., date of birth, gender, marital status); (3) Internet protocol (or IP) address or device ID/UDID; (4) mother’s maiden name (parent’s name prior to marriage); (5) drivers’ license numbers; (6) asset and income information; (7) bank account and credit/debit card numbers; (8) racial or ethnic origin; (9) purchase information regarding our products and services; and (10) vehicle identification numbers (VIN’s).<br><br>

								The means by which Saleen collects such personal information may include when you: (1) purchase, order, or request information about our products and services through the Web Site; (2) access a Saleen social media platform; (3) sign up for e-mail notifications, electronic newsletters, mobile messages (including SMS), or social media notifications from, or on behalf of, Saleen; (4) enter or participate in a Saleen contest, event, promotion or sweepstakes, or respond to one of our surveys; (5) provide Saleen with comments, suggestions or other input through the Web Site; and (6) create a user account for use in connection with the Website (your “User Account”). Saleen also collects such personal information in our marketing efforts on third party websites.<br><br>

								We may also receive information about you from third party sources, using Personal Information collected through the Website as the method of identifying you. Our use of that third party-sourced information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

								Saleen or a partner may sponsor promotions, sweepstakes or contests through the Website. Your participation is entirely voluntary. Users may be asked to provide personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, your name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. Saleen may also transfer Personal Information to certain advertising or marketing partners from whom you have requested to receive information.<br><br>







								<br>
								Additional Ways that Information is Collected Through the Website<br><br>

								Browser Log Files: Our servers automatically log each visitor to the Website and collect and record certain information about each visitor. This information includes or may include your “Internet Protocol”, or IP, address, browser language, browser type, operating system, domain names, browsing history (including time spent at a domain, time and date of your visit), referring/exit web pages and URLs, and number of clicks. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about the visitor other than the IP address from which the user has accessed the Website.<br><br>

								Cookies: From time to time, Saleen and/or our advertisers or other third parties may send a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive and that can be re-sent to the serving website on subsequent visits. A cookie, by itself, cannot read other data from your hard disk or read other cookie files already on your computer. A cookie, by itself, does not damage your system. We, our advertisers and other third parties may use cookies to identify and keep track of, among other things, those areas of the Website and third party websites that you have visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Website. You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser, but some functionality of the Website may be impaired or not function as intended if you choose not to accept cookies. See the Third Party Opt Out section below.<br><br>

								Web Beacons: Some of our web pages and electronic communications may contain images, which may or may not be visible to you, known as Web Beacons (sometimes referred to as “clear gifs”). Web Beacons collect only limited information that includes a cookie number; time and date of a page view; and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides. We may also carry Web Beacons placed by third party advertisers. These Web Beacons do not carry any Personal Information and are only used to track usage of the Website and activities associated with the Website. See the Third Party Opt Out section below.<br><br>

								Unique Identifier: We may assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the information you see on the Website and some of the electronic communications you receive from us. We keep this information for our internal use, and this information is not shared with others.<br><br>

								Third Party Opt Out: We may allow third-party companies to serve advertisements and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (including, but not limited to, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party Web Beacon to collect this information, as further described above. Through these technologies, the third party may have access to and use non-personalized information about your online usage activity.<br><br>

								You can opt-out of certain online behavioral services through any one of the ways described below (you do not need to go to each opt-out site, one is sufficient). After you opt-out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but those advertisements will no longer be as relevant to you.<br><br>

								• You can configure your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.) to delete and/or control the use of cookies. More information can be found in the Help system of your browser. It is at your discretion whether you use the opt-out described above or manage cookies via the browser.<br><br>

								Note: If you opt-out as described above, you should not delete your cookies. If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again.<br><br>
