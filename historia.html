									Saleen History
								</div>
							
						
								<br>
									Born from the racetrack and raised on California asphalt, Saleen Automotive roared into life in 1983 under the fearless vision of Steve Saleen—a former Formula Atlantic driver with gasoline in his veins and a dream to build America’s ultimate performance machines. What began with a modified Mustang and a bold idea quickly turned into a revolution in American performance engineering.
								<br><br>
								By the late ‘80s, Saleen wasn’t just tuning Mustangs—they were dominating race circuits, clinching wins and breaking records with precision-tuned vehicles that pushed the limits of speed and handling. From SCCA championships to world records at Bonneville, Saleen proved again and again that performance wasn’t just about horsepower—it was about relentless innovation, motorsport pedigree, and a refusal to blend in.
								<br><br>
								The ‘90s and 2000s ushered in Saleen’s golden age of supercar development. Enter the Saleen S7—America’s first true production supercar and a thunderous declaration that the U.S. could go toe-to-toe with Europe’s best. With its carbon-fiber body, mid-engine layout, and track-bred engineering, the S7 didn’t just turn heads—it rewrote the rules of what an American car could be.
								<br><br>
								Today, Saleen continues to define high-performance cool. From custom-built Mustangs and Camaros to the all-electric Saleen S1 and the rebirth of Team Saleen culture, the brand stays true to its racing roots while charging into the future. For over four decades, Saleen has stood for one thing above all: Speed, style, and attitude—without compromise.
